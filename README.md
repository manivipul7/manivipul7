### 🚀 About Me
I’m an **Aerospace Engineer and Space‑Systems Generalist** with 3+ years of experience bridging **astrodynamics**, **structural mechanics**, and **space mechanisms design**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **hands-on mechancial design and data driven simulation** to design and validate hardware that survives launch, is functional and operational in orbit.

- **Mechanisms & Structures:** Designing primary structures and compliant mechanical systems in *Siemens NX*, *SolidWorks*, and *ANSYS Mechanical/Simcenter 3D*.  
- **Systems Integration:** Translating ECSS and NASA requirements into verified, test-ready designs that have undergone *vibration, thermal, and TVAC qualification*.  
- **Astrodynamics & Mission Design:** Experienced in Python‑based modeling, sensitivity analysis, and geometry automation for satellite dynamic environments, orbital trades, and control‑structure interaction.
