### 🚀 About Me
I’m an **Aerospace Engineer and Space‑Systems Generalist** with 3+ years of experience bridging **astrodynamics**, **structural mechanics**, and **space mechanisms design**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **simulation and physical realization** — designing and validating hardware that survives launch, works flawlessly in orbit, and tells a story of precise engineering.

- **Mechanisms & Structures:** Designing primary structures and compliant mechanical systems in *Siemens NX*, *SolidWorks*, and *ANSYS Mechanical/Simcenter 3D* — from static, modal, and buckling analyses to nonlinear and transient response under space‑flight loads.  
- **Systems Integration:** Translating ECSS and NASA requirements into verified, test-ready designs that have undergone *vibration, thermal, and TVAC qualification*.  
- **Astrodynamics & Mission Design:** Experienced in Python‑based modeling, sensitivity analysis, and geometry automation for satellite dynamic environments, orbital trades, and control‑structure interaction.  
- **Past Projects:**  
  - Compliant fast‑steering mirrors for optical communication terminals.  
  - Structural sizing of CubeSat and small launch‑vehicle frames.  
  - Deployable solar arrays and optical payload interfaces for Earth‑observation missions.  
  - Hyperloop and rocket component FEA under ECSS and AIAA standards.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy
> Systems thinking, verified in code and confirmed by test.

I thrive on **multi‑disciplinary problem solving**, connecting astrodynamics with structural dynamics and mechanical design. My goal: to build hardware that’s **lightweight, manufacturable, and flight‑proven** — grounded in analysis but optimized through computational automation.  
Python workflows and parametric CAD tools help me iterate faster, visualize system sensitivities, and make data‑driven design decisions.
