## About Me

Aerospace engineer and space-systems generalist with 3+ years of experience spanning astrodynamics, structural mechanics, thermal–mechanical design, and space mechanisms. My work ranges from designing compliant fast steering mirrors for optical communication terminals to sizing CubeSat and launch‑vehicle structures, with a consistent focus on translating system-level requirements into robust, test‑validated hardware.

On the structural side, I design and analyze mechanisms and primary structures in Siemens NX, SolidWorks, and ANSYS Mechanical/Simcenter 3D, covering static, modal, buckling, nonlinear, and transient response under launch and in‑orbit environments. This includes ECSS‑compliant FEA for satellite mechanisms, Hyperloop pod structures, and rocket components, often validated with vibration, thermal, TVAC, and experimental modal testing.

My background in astrodynamics and mission design comes from an M.Sc. in Space Engineering at TU Berlin and multiple spacecraft projects, where I worked on deployable solar arrays, optical payload interfaces, and Earth observation satellite subsystems. I use Python for parametric modeling, sensitivity studies, and automated design iterations, enabling fast geometry updates and design trades across structural, thermal, and control performance.

I enjoy working at the interfaces: coordinating with systems, thermal, electrical, AIT, and suppliers; interpreting standards such as ECSS, ISO, AIAA, and NASA guidelines; and documenting designs through clear requirements, trade studies, and test reports. Across projects—from CubeSat mechanisms and Hyperloop pods to compliant mirror actuators and impact‑tested components—my focus is integrating astrodynamics, mechanical design, and structural/thermal simulation into coherent system solutions that are ready for manufacturing, test, and flight.
